Hello everyone. Welcome to my website! This site is going to be more than the traditional Software Developer's website. I do not want it to only be for my portfolio, but I want to be able to use this as a place to host my projects. Of course, my portfolio with all of my projects are available here as they should.

## A little blurb about me

If you want to learn more about me, please check out the about me page, but just as a quick "get to know me" sort of thing, this is me. I am a Software Developer. I do not know if I would call myself a front-end, back-end, full-stack, or some other restrictive title like those. I love to write code. Plain and simple. I enjoy designing the front-end of a webpage, although being color blind makes it a challenge! The feeling of accomplishment after linking the front-end to the back-end and successfully querying the database is unexplainable to a non-developer. This is what I want to do.
