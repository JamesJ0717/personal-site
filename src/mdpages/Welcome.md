## Hi Everybody

Welcome to my website. This is going to be like a blog site, but also like a portfolio. 

#### Purpose

As I said, this is going to be used like a portfolio. However, I am using Gatsby, which is used in a lot of blogs. I ___really___ like how Gatsby has plugins for handling converting `Markdown` files into pretty `HTML`.

#### Portfolio
  
If you want to check out some projects I've worked on, check out [Portfolio][1].

#### Other Stuff

For other stuff I do on the side, not just coding projects, check out [Other Stuff][2].
