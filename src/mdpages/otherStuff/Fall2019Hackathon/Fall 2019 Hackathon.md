This semesters hackathon has come and gone yet again, and with it came a great day of fun and learning. This was my second time participating, and I feel as though I had improved dramatically, so much so that my team awarded me with the most improved.

## CNY Hackathon

For those of you who do not know about CNY Hackathon, it is an event that takes place once a semester where teams attempt to defend and maintain a small network from a group of _"hackers"_ known as the red team. Along with the defense, or infrastructure as its called internally, there are CTF challenges and a third _"toss up"_ category.

This year, the _"toss up"_ was to code a raspberry pi based robot to enter a _disaster zone_ and survey the building for survivors. This challenge seemed super cool and something that was right up my alley with the software development aspect. However, I decided to focus all of my attention on the infrastructure; keeping our services up and running as well as we could. There was one other member on my team that was helping out with this stuff, and, to be honest, we were really crushing it for the most part.

## Services (Infrastructure ((Defense)))

So since I focused just about all of my time on the service side of things, that's what I'll focus on here too. As I said before, it was one other guy from my team, who I happened to know from school, and myself running the show.

Within our network that we are given, there were 8 machines. We had a router, a web server, a database server, a DNS Server, a backup server, and 3 Kali Linux machines.
