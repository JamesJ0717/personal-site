This is a super straight-forward web-app. All it does is generate bars of random lengths (heights) and allows the user to sort them. The bar on the top of the page has three algorithms that I can distinctly remember from my `Data Structures and Algorithms` class in college. The magic happens using React's `useState` hook. When a new option is clicked, the bars are, unfortunately, re-generated in a sorted manner. I say unfortunately in the last sentence because I do not want the bars to change their height. I think it would be better if the bars would have stayed the same, but I was unable to figure that out in the time I gave myself. I like to try to test myself with these short weekend projects to keep me on my toes and learning.
