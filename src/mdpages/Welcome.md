### Hi Everybody

Welcome to my website. This is going to be like a blog site, but also like a portfolio, but also including _'posts'_ about things I do or am working on that are fun.

#### Me

A little bit about me... I am a computer guy. I don't know how I would describe myself quickly and in a few words. I like working with computers; whether it be software engineering, sysadmining, security stuff, networking, or just playing around with a new technology, I always have fun. I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science and Network & Computer Security. After graduation, I still don't really know what I want to do. All I know is, I want to work with computers in some way, _one of the aforementioned ways would be ideal_.

#### Purpose

As I said, this is going to be used like a portfolio. However, I am using Gatsby, which is used in a lot of blogs. I _**really**_ like how Gatsby has plugins for handling converting `Markdown` files into pretty `HTML`. Gatsby is built off of React, so I get all of the benefits of reactive components and responsiveness from React, while now being able to write all of my pages in Markdown and have them displayed nicely as HTML.
