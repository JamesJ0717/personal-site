A HomeLab is a place for people to play around with new technologies or equipment. I heard about these when on Reddit. The community of HomeLabers has a subreddit, [/r/HomeLab][1], which is a great place to learn. HomeLabs can be as simple as an old computer or as in-depth as a full '42U Rack'.

## Mine

My HomeLab right now is very basic. I have a Raspberry Pi 3 and an old laptop. The Pi is running Ubuntu Server and the laptop is running `Proxmox`, which is an open source KVM.
